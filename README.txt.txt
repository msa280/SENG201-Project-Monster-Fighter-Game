    enjoy the ambient music for a while ;).


2.) After clicking "PLAY", you are given a bunch of avatars to choose from. Once you pick an avatar, 
    the "NEXT" option is going to show up allowing you to progress to the game setup screen. 
    There are plenty of avatar options to choose from so take your time choosing one!


3.) The game setup screen consists of a few parts.You are allowed to enter a valid player name along 
    with the option to choose a starting monster for your game. You can open up the statistics of these 
    starting monsters by clicking "view stats". Each monster has its own statistics view card so you can
    pull out all the monster cards to decide which one you want to add to your team. You can also 
    optionally rename your monster and choose the difficulty level and the number of days you want the 
    game to last. Once done, Click "START GAME" to go to the game's main menu.


4.) In the main menu, you can perform a bunch of actions which including viewing your team, inventory and
    the shop. You can also choose a battle or decide to sleep depending on your mood. A "Quit Game" 
    option is available incase you feel like not playing anymore. The main menu also displays your 
    current gold, current day and the days remaining. This will help you keep track of how you are 
    progressing!


5.) In the "View Team" section, you can see the monsters you have. You can also see your current gold.
    You can either rename those monsters, sell them or see their stats along with their health bars. 
    A go back button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want. The resale price of the
    monsters is available which will show you how much gold can be earned if you decide to sell the 
    monster. A sell option is available to get rid of your poor monster too. You can also view the 
    monster stats in this section.


6.) In the "View Inventory" section, you can see the items you have along with their respective 
    quantities. Now if you feel like selling an item, a sell option is also available here. You won't get
    the same amount of money for the item but will be compensated handsomely.You will see you gold 
    updated once you sell the item. A use item option is also available. For using an item, you have to 
    select the monster from your team you want to use the item on from the drop down menu. Once an item 
    is used, it will either disappear if it was the last item or the quantity will decrease by 1.
    A "Go Back" button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want. You may also view the 
    item effects before you decide to use it on a specific monster! 


7.) In the "View Shop" section, you are presented with a list of 5 monsters and 5 items to choose from. 
    You can see you current player gold to keep track of your spendings. If you buy a monster or an 
    item, you will get an updated message in the update section right below the Items section. This tells
    you about the action you performed and what took place inside the game. This section is present in 
    most parts of the game and is only there to remind you of certain effects that took place. You can 
    also view the effects of an item or the stats of a monster you are thinking to buy. A "Go Back" 
    button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want.


8.) In the "View Battles" section, a new screen will pop up showing the number of battles available. You
    can fight each battle once so choose your team wisely and make sure that the health of your monsters
    have regenerated before participating in a fight. The number of battles shown depends on your 
    difficulty settings. Once a battle is over, the "FIGHT" button for that enemy will disappear. This 
    means that you have already fought that enemy and that option is no longer available. If you try to 
    fight an enemy when all your monsters are fainted or you do not have any monsters, an error message
    will remind you of your shortcomings!  A "Go Back" button is present to take you back to the main 
    menu if you want.
   

9.) If you have enough aggression to fight an enemy, you will be taken to a volcanic arena. Yes! 
    Here your monster will show up according to their position in the team. Each monster has a basic 
    attack and a special attack. Once a certain amount of normal attacks are completed, your special 
    attack will be generated. This attack carries more damage and can significantly hurt the enemy
    monster.(TIP: Do not use special attacks when an enemy monster is already low!". Save your special
    attack for the next enemy monster as it deals more damage!") After a series of attacks, the current
    monster on either side might faint! This will lead to the next available monster spawning and 
    fighting. This goes on until all of the monsters have fainted on either side! ITS A FIGHT TO THE
    DEATH! Once the battle is complete and one of the sides had fainted, their monster will disappear. 
    The monster that took the final kill will remain on the screen. This is a display of dominance 
    showing that the arena belongs to that monster now! Once the battle is over, a "LEAVE ARENA" button 
    will pop up allowing you to leave the arena. YOU CANNOT QUIT OR ESCAPE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE! 
    After leaving the arena, you will be taken back to your team menu to show you the current health and 
    statistics of your monsters after a battle. Your monsters will definitely need healing too! A battle 
    card will pop up showing you the exact statistics of how the battle went and also shows the winner of
    the battle.


10.) If the sleep button is clicked, the player will progress to the next day until all days are complete.
     This is when the game will be over. The aim of the game is to achieve the highest number of points.
     Once the days are complete, the game will be over! If the player sleeps, all of the monster will 
     heal up overnight by their heal amount. New items and monsters will be generated in the shop for 
     that day along with newer refreshed battles. A certain ppossibility of a random monster joining, 
     leaving or a present monster levelling up can also occur. After sleeping, a "Good Morning" message 
     is given to alert and update the player regarding what happend when he slept. Click "Okay" to close 
     this screen once all the details have been read. Once the number of days run out, the game will end
     with a "GAME OVER" message outlining the game statistics and player points.


Enjoy the game ...
GOOD LUCK!

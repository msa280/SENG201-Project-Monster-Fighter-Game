Welcome to our game Monster Fighter!
This README file is a small instruction manual on how to play the game.


1.) Game starts with an intro screen which represents the introduction to the game. 
    Click the PLAY button to start the game.

2.) Character selection. You are given a bunch of avatars to choose from. Once you pick an avatar, the "NEXT" option is going to show up. 
    Click it to progress to the game setup screen.

3.) Game setup screen consists of a few parts. Interesting! You are allowed to enter a valid player name along with the option to choose a starting monster for your game.
    You can also optionally rename your monster and choose the difficulty level and the number of days you want the game to last. 
    Click "START GAME" once all criteria has matched.

4.) This will then take you to the Main Menu screen. 
    Over here, you can perform a bunch of actions which including viewing your team, inventory and the shop. 
    You can also choose a battle and decide to sleep as well.
    A quit game option is available incase you feel like not playing anymore.
    The main menu also displays your current gold, current day and the days remaining. This helps you keep track of how you are progressing!

5.) In the view team section, you can see the number of monsters you have. 
    You can also see your current gold.
    You can either rename those monsters, sell them or see their stats along with their healthbars. 
    A go back button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want.

6.) In the view inventory section, you can see the items you have along with their respective quantities.
    Now if you feel like selling an item, dont worry at all! We have a sell option available right next to the item. You will see you gold updated once you sell the item.
    A use item option is also available. For using an item, you have to select the monster from your team you want to use the item on from the drop down menu. 
    Once an item is used, it will either disappear if it was the last item or the quanitity will decrease. This works in the same way as selling an item.
    A go back button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want.

7.) In the shop section, you are presented with a list of 5 monsters and 5 items to choose from.
    You can see you current player gold to keep track of your spendings.
    If you buy a monster or an item, you will get an updated message in the update section right below the Items section. This tells you about the action you performed.
    You can also view the effects of an item or view the stats of a monster you are thinking to buy. Great isnt it!
    A go back button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want.

8.) In the view battles section, a new screen will pop up showing the number of battles available. You can fight each battle once so choose your team wisely and make sure 
    that the health of your monsters have regenerated.
    The number of battles shown depends on your difficulty settings.
    Once a battle is over, the "FIGHT" button for that enemy will disappear. This means that you have already fought that enemy and that option is no longer available.
    If you try to fight an enemy when all your monsters are fainted or you do not have any monsters, an error message will remind you of your shortcomings! 
    A go back button is present to take you back to the main menu if you want.

9.) If you have enough aggression to fight an enemy, you will be taken to a volcanic arena. Yes! 
    Here your monster will show up according to their position in the team. Each monster has a basic attack and a special attack. Once a certain amount of normal attacks are completed,
    your special attack will be generated. This attack carries more damage and can significantly hurt the enemy monster. 
    (TIP: Do not use special attacks when an enemy monster is already low!". Save your special attack for the next enemy monster as it deals more damage!")
    After a series of attacks, the current monster on either side might faint! This will lead to the next available monster spawning and fighting. 
    This goes on until all of the monster have fainted on either side! ITS A FIGHT TO THE DEATH! 
    Once the fighting is complete and one of the side has fainted, their monster will disappear. The monster that took the final kill will remain on the screen. 
    This is a display of dominance showing that the arena belongs to that monster now! HAHAH! 
    Once the battle is over, a "LEAVE ARENA" button will pop up allowing you to leave the arena. YOU CANNOT QUIT OR ESCAPE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE! 
    After leaving the arena, you will be taken back to your team menu to show you the current health and statistics of your team after a fight! Your monsters will definitely need healing too!
    A battle statistics screen will pop up showing you the exact statistics of how the battle with the enemy went and showing the winner of the battle. This is the battle card!

10.) If the sleep button is clicked, the player will progress to the next day until all days are complete. This is when the game will be over. The aim of the game is to achieve the highest 
     number of points. Once the days are complete, the game will be over!
     If the player sleeps, all of the monster will heal up overnight by their heal amount. New items and monsters will be generated in the shop for that day along with newer refreshed battles.
     A certain probability of a random monster joining, leaving or a monster levelling up can also occur.
     After sleeping, Good Morning message is given to the player updating the player on what happend when he slept. Click "Okay" to close this screen once all the details have been read.
